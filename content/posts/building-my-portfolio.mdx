# Building My Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! In this post, I'll share how I built this site and the technologies I chose.

## Tech Stack

I chose a modern, powerful stack for this portfolio:

- **Next.js 16** - The React framework for production
- **Tailwind CSS v3** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **MDX** - Markdown with React components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development

## The Midnight Wolf Theme

I created a custom dark theme called "Midnight Wolf" with these colors:

- Background: `#0B0C10` - Deep, dark blue-black
- Cards: `#1F2833` - Slightly lighter for contrast
- Text: `#C5C6C7` - Soft gray for readability
- Accent: `#66FCF1` - Bright cyan for highlights
- Hover: `#45A29E` - Teal for interactive states

## Why MDX?

MDX allows me to write blog posts in Markdown while embedding React components. This means I can create rich, interactive content without leaving the comfort of Markdown.

For example, I can use components like badges directly in my posts!

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:

1. Project showcase section
2. Contact form
3. Dark/light mode toggle
4. Blog categories and tags
5. Search functionality

Stay tuned for more updates!
